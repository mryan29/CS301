- Context Free Grammar

## Fair Game Topics
**6 Questions (5pts each)**
- Definitions
- Matching
- True/False
- Fill in the blank

## Producing an NFA
1. Language is regular
2. Composite union/intersection

## Irregularity Proof
- S = xyz (4pts)
- Showing (4pts)
- Paperwork (2pts)

- Go by contradiction 
- L &rarr; DFA M
- M &rarr; ...
- ...
- Therefore L is irregular

## NFA to DFA
- At least 1 extension (?) (3pts)
- States that can't be reached? (2pts)

## NFA to Grammar
- SS -> EES
- FS -> E

## Regular Grammar to DFA
