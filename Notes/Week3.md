# Review
Regular languages
- any language that can be decided by DFA
- can be infinite in size
- constructed from set and string ops

Closure 
- an operation is closed over a set if the input and output are from the same set
- if we can show the ops are closed over the regular language, we can build languages from these operations without having to prove that they're regular

## Review Q
What language does the following DFA Accept?
- **b.**
because it's a binary string, it must start with a 0
...

# Closure
Suppose A and B are regular languages. Prove A U B is regular.
By Def exist DFA Ma, Mb which recognize it, which means it have those 5 MFA properties which define it.
