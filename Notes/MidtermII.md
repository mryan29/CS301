# Midterm II Review
November 9th, 2018

Not cumulative, post-midterm on (exception may be definitions)

cfl only thru last fridays lecture

# Topics
1. Context-Free Languages
  - ggenerating cfg
  - creating pda
  - converting cfl to pda
  - cnf
  - non context free proofs
  - (non) determinism
2. Turing Machines
- state diagrams
- implementation-level descriptions
- robustness
  - given a change, how does this affect expressability
- turing-decidability
- reductions
  - given that a is decidable, 
  - empty dfa problem = acceptance dfa problem ...
- halting problem
  - recognizable (v. decidable)
  - don't need to do reductions to halting, will be to decidable
3. General
- proofs
  - regular languages
- closure
- definitions (including from first midterm)

# On appendix
- every language shown decidable
- cf pumping lemma
- discrete math info - no primes
- cnf ordering

# Format
1. 10 MC
2. 4 short answer
3. not creating a cfg, possibly: create pda, determine what language pda or cfg accepts, chomsky normal form (likely)
4.
5. choice of two

# PDAS
- clearly define stack alphabet
- end of stack char $
- build from cfg
- non-determinism
- using stack as counter and using special chars
