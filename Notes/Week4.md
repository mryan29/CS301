# September 17th - Regular Expressions

# Review
**Regular expressions**

common search style
- grep
- find

helpful for solving problems
- searching formatted strings
- verifying data in expected format
- sorting, categorizing

practice: regex golf

regular expression: any formatted object which can uniquely identify ...

proofs for regex rely on our proofs from dfa/nfa

base cases:
- ∅: empty language is regular language
- &epsilon; - empty string is reg lang
- 'a' - sing char in alpha is reg language

ops: 
- union U - if r1 and r2 are reg, then r1 U r2 is reg (may sometimes use a|b)
- ^o concatenation - if r1 and r2 are reg, then r1 ^o r2 is reg (may sometimes use (ab))
- * kleene star, if r1 is reg, then r1* is reg

order of ops:
- parentheses AB* != (AB)*
- kleene star
- concatenation
- union

- union - commutative and associative
  - AU(BUC) = (AUB)UC, AUB=BUA
- concatenation- assoc, distributive over union 
  - A(BC) = (AB)C
  - A(BUC) = AB U AC
- ∅* = &epsilon;

+ = 1 or more
* = 0 or more
&sigma; does not include empty string

Which language is generated by this regex: (&sigma;&sigma;)* &sigma; = {0,1}
a. w contains at least 2 symbols --> no, bc empty language
b.
c. no bc 01
d. no bc 01

What is the regex for binary strings that start and end with the same character?
- 0 (&sigma;)* 0 U 1 (&sigma;)* 1 --> c overrides this one bc it accounts for single chars
- 0 (&sigma; U &sigma;)* U 1 (&sigma; U &sigma;)* 1
- 0 (&sigma;)* 0 U 1 (&sigma;)* 1 U 1 U 0
- none of the above
none of these include the empty string --> if we saw this on an exam, would he take off if our answer didn't include empty string?

if &sigma; = {0,1} &rarr; {0} U {1} &rarr; &sigma;* = (0 U 1)*

0 U 1 U 0 &sigma;*0 U 1&sigma;*1

Regular expression for set of all langages (binary strings) where every 0 has a 1 immediately after it?
- 1*(011*)* --> doesn't include 11 x yes it does
- (1 U 01)* --> doesn't include 01
- 1*((0U&epsilon;)1)*
- (01 U 1*)*
- **all of the above**

01 -> included in all of them
1* -> included in all of them

There is no intersection or complement. However they don't increase the expressive power.
